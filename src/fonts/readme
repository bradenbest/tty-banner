Format:

An entry looks like this:

+A
. * . .
* . * .
* * * .
* . * .
* . * .
-

'+' denotes the character the glyph represents. In this case, 'A'. The character must immediately follow the +.

After this, it's a series of exactly 20 (4x5) characters of either '*' (1) or '.' (0). Whitespace is allowed.

The sequence is ended by a '-'

Ideally, you want to leave the fourth column blank for kerning purposes. You don't want the text smashed together, now, do you?

When stripped, it would look like this: +A.*..*.*.***.*.*.*.*.-
